## Execution Guidance
- **order_type:** limit
- **limit_offset:** limit: Buy 0.5% below market in uptrend.
- **timing:** SAFE TO BUY. Position sizes are already risk-adjusted by volatility — higher vol stocks get smaller positions automatically.
- **scaling:** Enter in 3 tranches over 1-2 weeks.

## Positions — Vol-Adjusted Risk (per-stock sizing)

*Each position has different stop/target/size based on its volatility. Higher vol = wider stop + smaller size.*

> **Vol-adjusted sizing:** Volatile stocks (TSLA, NVDA) get wider stops + smaller positions.
> Stable stocks (KO, PG) get tighter stops + larger positions. This is proper risk management.
